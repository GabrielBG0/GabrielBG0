### Hi there, I'm Gabriel Borges Gutierrez! 🚀

🌎 Based in Campinas, SP, Brazil  
🎓 PhD Student in Computer Science @ Unicamp  
🔧 Software Engineer | 🤖 Researcher in Machine Learning & Computer Vision  
🌐 Fluent in English and Portuguese | 🗾 JLPT N5 Certified in Japanese  

#### About Me

I am a researcher and software engineer with a strong interest in **machine learning, computer vision, and self-supervised learning**. My background combines solid software engineering foundations with applied research experience, allowing me to bridge the gap between **theoretical advances** and **practical implementations**.  

👨‍🎓 I hold a **Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering** and a **Master’s degree in Computer Science**, where I specialized in deep learning and Transformer-based architectures.  

📚 Currently, I am pursuing a **PhD in Computer Science at the University of Campinas (Unicamp)**. My research focuses on:  
- **Efficient self-supervised learning (SSL)** methods for vision and multimodal models  
- **Robustness and adaptability of foundation models**  
- **Scalability and distributed training** for large-scale models  

🛠️ I am also one of the **core maintainers and software architect** of the open-source project [**Minerva**](https://github.com/discovery-unicamp/Minerva), which provides scalable and flexible tools for deep learning research. My work on Minerva bridges research and engineering by enabling reproducible experiments, large-scale training, and model debugging.  

🗾 In addition to my technical work, I also hold the **Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT) N5 certificate**, reflecting my interest in languages and cross-cultural exchange.
